Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

# Solution 1
SELECT name as Customers
FROM Customers C
WHERE C.Id NOT IN (SELECT O.CustomerId from Orders O)

# Solution 2
SELECT name as Customers
FROM Customers A LEFT JOIN Orders B on  A.Id = B.CustomerId
WHERE B.CustomerId is NULL

# Solution 3
SELECT name as Customers
FROM Customers A
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT name FROM Orders B WHERE A.Id = B.CustomerId)
